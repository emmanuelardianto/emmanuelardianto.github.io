Hi, Iâ€™m Emmanuel ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a software engineer based in Japan with over 9 years of experience in PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js.  
Iâ€™ve built and maintained ecommerce platforms, and Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and Go to deepen my full-stack development skills.

Outside of coding, I enjoy photography and documenting daily life in Japan through visual storytelling.

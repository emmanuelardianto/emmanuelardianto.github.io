title = 'Day 4 Learning Typescript Class: Readonly Inheritance Abstract'
+++


```Readonly property```, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned. Note: whenever assigning a value to a variable, in JavaScript the variable is pointing to a location, not a value. So the property value could be changed, but not reassigned.

#### Private vs Protected
Private can be accessed within a class, Protected allows an inherited class to access it.

#### Abstract class.
Abstract class is a blueprint for another class. It canâ€™t be instantiated directly.

#### Interface
allows to define the type of an Object, essentially a contract that can be implemented by classes.
